# CPU-Simulator
Developed a CPU simulator in Racket to emulate a custom architecture, featuring instruction set implementation, register handling, and memory management. Enabled execution of assembly-like commands for testing and validating CPU operations, offering insights into low-level computational processes and efficient performance analysis.
